Hi and welcome to my GSoC blog! This is the first post in a series of reports on the progress of [GTK 4 Rust Bindings](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5172521249275904).

The initial development is driven by making simple programs and existing examples work, so that we have a set of core features to develop from.

## Examples

You can find example gtk4-rs programs at [https://github.com/sfanxiang/gtk-rs-examples4](https://github.com/sfanxiang/gtk-rs-examples4). It's based on [gtk-rs examples](https://github.com/gtk-rs/examples). Available examples include:
```
accessibility
basic
builder_basics
cairotest
cairo_threads
clock
css
drag_and_drop
drag_and_drop_textview
grid
gtktest
listbox_model
list_store
menu_bar
menu_bar_system
multithreading_context
multi_windows
notebook
overlay
pango_attributes
progress_tracker
simple_treeview
sync_widgets
text_viewer
transparent_main_window
tree_model_sort
treeview
```

## gtk4-rs

The gtk4-rs repository is at [https://github.com/sfanxiang/gtk-rs-gtk4](https://github.com/sfanxiang/gtk-rs-gtk4). Currently this is a work in progress. Changes here most closely follows upstream gtk4. If there's anything special to point out, I'll note it in a future post.

## graphene-rs

The repository is at [https://github.com/sfanxiang/gtk-rs-graphene](https://github.com/sfanxiang/gtk-rs-graphene). It's feature-complete, with the exception of simd4f and simd4x4f. These are C structures and do not use the glib model.
