This is the final report on [GTK 4 Rust Bindings](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5172521249275904). You can find project links and repositories on [the about page](https://sfanxiang.github.io/gsoc-2019/about/).

## Describe my work briefly

- Add Rust support to the gtk4 toolkit, including
  - gtk4
  - gsk4
  - gdk4
  - graphene
- Port gtk3 Rust examples to gtk4.

## What is done

- gtk4-rs: [https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4)

The is the main API for gtk4 software development. Changes in gtk4 are reflected here, including new layout managers, deprecation of child properties, and new/removed widgets.

- gsk4-rs: [https://github.com/gtk-rs/gsk4](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gsk4)

The new GTK Scene Kit API callable from Rust, featuring the extensive render nodes type system highlighted in previous posts.

- gdk4-rs: [https://github.com/gtk-rs/gdk4](https://github.com/gtk-rs/gdk4)

gdk4 has undergone a lot of changes since its last version, with refined interaction between gtk. It's overhauled event system was specially bound in Rust too.

- graphene-rs: [https://github.com/gtk-rs/graphene](https://github.com/gtk-rs/graphene)
- examples: [https://github.com/sfanxiang/gtk-rs-examples4](https://github.com/sfanxiang/gtk-rs-examples4) (will be upstreamed)
- Low-level, unsafe bindings: [https://github.com/gtk-rs/sys/pull/145](https://github.com/gtk-rs/sys/pull/145)
- Automatic creation of gtk4 dependency bundle: [https://github.com/sfanxiang/gtk-bootstrap](https://github.com/sfanxiang/gtk-bootstrap)

## Future work

- Improve Rust-specific documentation in https://github.com/gtk-rs/lgpl-docs.
- More bindings. There's always more we can do.
- CI support for OSX and Windows.
