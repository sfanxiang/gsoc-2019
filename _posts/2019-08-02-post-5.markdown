This is the fifth post in a series of reports on the progress of [GTK 4 Rust Bindings](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5172521249275904). You can find project links and repositories on [the about page](https://sfanxiang.github.io/gsoc-2019/about/).

Apart from preparing to upstream the crates, I've been keeping the shared code of gtk4-rs and gtk3-rs in sync and adding more types to gdk4-rs.

## Merging graphene and graphene-sys in one repo

The idea came from my mentor, Jordan Petridis. Managing graphene and graphene-sys in one place will make these relatively self-contained crates easier to maintain. A build system was set up for them. The graphene repo is now ready for upstreaming.

## Additions to gdk4-rs

- `ContentDeserializer` and `ContentDeserializer`, along with their helper functions, are implemented.
- The `Event` typing system is implemented. It was determined from gdk4 source code whether a method applies to a subtype.

## Rebasing examples

A lot of changes after gtk4 examples branched were merged to gtk4 examples. New examples from upstream, namely `builders`, `clipboard_simple`, and `entry_completion`, are implemented in gtk4.
